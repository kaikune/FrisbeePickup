        RIC3 Family Ultimate Frisbee welcomes everyone, which includes kids, youth and adults to toss a frisbee and play ultimate together. 
        We play by Ultimate's 10 simple rules plus RIC3 Family house modifications <a href="http://www.ric3family.com/familyfrisbeerules">here</a>.
        We work to make even matchups and utilize other creative tactics to level the playing field.  
        We adhere to ultimate's Spirit of the Game, which means you play to win, but at the same time respect yourself, 
        teammates, opponents and the game itself. It also means the responsibility of fair play is placed on the athletes themselves, 
        rather than a referee.
