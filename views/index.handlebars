        RIC3 Family Ultimate Frisbee welcomes everyone, which includes kids, youth and adults to toss a frisbee and/or play ultimate together.  
        We work to make even matchups and utilize “Family Frisbee rules” (link) to establish a level playing field.  
        We adhere to ultimate’s Spirit of the Game, which means you play to win, but at the same time respect yourself, 
        teammates, opponents and the game itself.  
        It also means the responsibility of fair play is placed on the athletes themselves, rather than a referee.

        Every Saturday night, from January through March, we will have an Indoor Family Ultimate Frisbee & 
        Community Night event at the Round Out Municipal Center.  
        Please note, when we are inside, we play with a soft disc. Check the events section for details.
